# Guess My Number - Minigame

## Description
This GitHub repo is a simple mini project to practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript. To make it more engaging, I added styles to the HTML to enhance my HTML and CSS skills. The goal was to make the HTML accessible for everyone and responsive to any device using media queries.

## Features
- Multiple difficulty levels: Beginner, Normal, Hard, God.
- High score tracking for each difficulty level.
- Responsive design for an optimal user experience on all devices.
- Accessible design with screen reader support.
- Shake effect for incorrect guesses and visual cues for winning and losing.

## Usage
1. Select a difficulty level.
2. Enter your guess and click "Check!" or press the "Enter" key.
3. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Click "Again!" to start a new game.

## DOM Manipulation
In this project, I practiced the following DOM manipulation techniques:
- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements.
- Handling user input and events.
- Updating the content and styles of elements dynamically.
- Implementing game logic and state management.
